### Front-End

- **VITE** â€” Pre-configured packer is responsible for all construction parts of the project. [vite website](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **ContextAPI** - Hook a native of React for providing the application schemas, interpreting the relevant information with the entire application [Hooks Docs](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) -**CSS Modules** - It's a way of styling components that react in isolation.

## Applied business rules

- Unable to include a task without text
- Created tasks are born uncompleted by default
- When clicking on a to-do task it is marked as complete
- When you click on a completed task it becomes available again
- When removing a task it is permanently deleted
